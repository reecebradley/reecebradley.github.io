## First Post

Greetings citizens of planet Earth! I'm attempting to share thoughts about my latest adventures in technology - currently Docker.
I invite you to come along with me on my Docker journey and we'll see what kinds of things we can put in containers, especially in the world of Windows.

My blog is defintely a work in progress. It is a new thing using Jekyll themes and GitHub Pages. We'll see how well it'll work out for me and hopefully I'll hear from you!

Keep on Coding!
