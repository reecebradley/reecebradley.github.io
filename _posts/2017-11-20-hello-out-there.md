## Is this thing on?

I'm playing around, so this page may just get deleted.

```csharp
// Example
var c = "sharp";
```

```typescript
let foo = "bar";
```

```js
function wat(){
  alert('definitely');
}
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Blog] b
```

```powershell
docker run --rm --name "test-docker" microsoft/dotnet-samples:dotnetapp
```

```sh
git status
```

This concludes the tests for today.
