## It's a dangerous business...

Greetings citizens of planet Earth! My intent with this blog is to share my experiences in hopes of making the world a better place. I'll be exploring all kinds of technologies like: ASP.NET/.NET Core, C#, Docker, VSTS, Octopus Deploy, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Electron, etc. I'm also excited to explore big topics like software architecture, testing, and DevOps.

Starting a blog is a big effort with uncertain rewards - I see it as an adventure. No telling how far it'll go or who'll read it, but it'll be a new experience that I hope benifts everyone.

My blog is defintely a work in progress. It is a new thing using Jekyll, so there might be some churn on blog design until I settle on what I like and is efficient.
